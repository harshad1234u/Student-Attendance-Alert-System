# Student Attendance Monitoring & Alert System

## 📖 Overview
The **Student Attendance Monitoring & Alert System** is a Java console-based application designed to track student attendance, calculate attendance percentages, and automatically generate alerts for students whose attendance falls below a predefined threshold.
